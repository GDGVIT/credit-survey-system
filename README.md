	<h2 align="center"> Credit based survey system </h2>
	<h4 align="center">
Services like survey monkey charge their users to conduct a survery, in cases wheere users have a little to no funding this is a turn-off. The project aims to end this problem. The implementation will observe a survey system where students exchange credits by taking surveys and creating surveys. <br><br>
TL;DR, the user fills surveys on the platform and earn credits, and use these credits to create their own survey which would get alloted number of responses. So it's a wholesome platform where users help each other in collecting data
